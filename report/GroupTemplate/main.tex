\section{solution}
\label{sec:middleware_architecture}
The design of the system architecture is crucial to achieving the stated Quality Attribute Scenarios (QASes) outlined in the previous section. This section will delve into the proposed design that aims to ensure interoperability, availability, and continuous deployability of the system.

The designed architecture consists of five services with different programming languages and frameworks, two databases and various communication mechanisms including message broker. All of components are containerized through Docker and managed using Docker Compose. The system architecture diagram can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:system-architecture}. The communication between system components is illustrated in the Sequence diagram \ref{fig:sequence-diagram} found in Appendix A

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{diagrams/architecture-diagram.png}
    \caption{System architecture diagram}
    \label{fig:system-architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Services}
\label{sec:services}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Order management system (OMS) (C\#/ASP.NET)
    \item Production management system (PMS) (Python)
    \item Supply management system (SMS) (Java/Spring)
    \item Scheduler (Python)
    \item Logging (JavaScript/Node.js)
    \item Dashboard/Client (JavaScript/React)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Databases}
\label{sec:databases}
\begin{itemize}
    \item MongoDB (used by order management system to store orders)
    \item MySQL (used by supply management system to store resources)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Communication mechanisms}
\label{sec:communication-mechanisms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item MQTT (Mosquitto message broker)
    \item RestAPI
    \item WebSocket
\end{itemize}

To ensure availability, the system employs a robust monitoring strategy, utilizing a logging system that actively sends logs through websockets from multiple components. This proactive approach enables real-time fault detection, complemented by exception handling in critical areas of the production process to facilitate graceful recovery from faults.

Deployability is enhanced through a well-managed deployment pipeline, incorporating script deployment stages with various commands for linting, artifact uploading, testing, building, and pushing images. Git and GitHub Actions workflows are utilized for version control, continuous integration, and deployment management, ensuring a streamlined CI/CD process with effortless rollback capabilities.

Interoperability holds a pivotal role, especially in collaborations with external partners. The system architecture is deliberately crafted to facilitate seamless communication between the enterprise and external entities. The utilization of a microservices approach enables autonomous scaling and modification of services, catering to evolving business requirements. Despite introducing intricacies, advanced interfaces, and rigorous testing, this approach guarantees the system's adaptability and continuous availability. The system's structure is intentionally designed with modularity and scalability in mind, ensuring efficient handling of customer orders. The architecture embraces microservices to amplify flexibility and maintainability. Each microservice is dedicated to specific functionalities, such as order management, supply management, and production management.

To serve to diverse requirements and components, different programming languages are employed for various microservices within the system. For instance, C\# was used for order management due to its simplicity, while Java was chosen for resource-intensive tasks in supply management. This multilingual approach allows leveraging the strengths of each language for specific functionalities.
However, potential drawbacks include increased complexity and maintenance challenges associated with multiple programming languages.

The system adopts a diverse persistence approach, utilizing MySQL for the supply management system and MongoDB for the order management system. flyway, a reliable database migration tool, was employed specifically for the MySQL database to ensure seamless migration and version control. This strategic use of technologies addresses the unique data storage needs of each microservice, leveraging the strengths of MySQL's reliability and MongoDB's flexibility. The incorporation of flyway streamlines database management, mitigating challenges associated with evolving schemas. While managing multiple database technologies introduces complexity, the tailored solutions enhance performance and scalability for each microservice.

Point-to-point communication between microservices is facilitated through a combination of HTTP/REST APIs and WebSockets, Mosquitto message broker. HTTP/REST APIs are utilized for synchronous communication, enabling microservices to request and respond to each other's services. WebSocket and Mosquitto message broker are employed for asynchronous communication, allowing real-time updates while reducing response time. Mosquitto, an MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) broker, facilitates lightweight and efficient communication, especially suitable for scenarios where low latency and minimal overhead are crucial. This ensures reliable asynchronous communication and decoupling of services.

Containerization was implemented using Docker and Docker Compose to allow define and manage the services comprising the system. Each individual service had build Docker image inside CI/CD pipeline that would be push to Github Container Registry. Docker Compose simplified the orchestration and deployment of multiple containers, ensuring consistency across different environments, including development (local) and production (deployed to VM). However, approach using might to be suitable to make application completetly scalable as docker compose only allows to deploy to a single server. Better approach would be using Docker Swarm or more advanced scaling tool like K8s (Kubernetes) to manage containers deployed across multiple nodes. [14]

The Observer Pattern is applied in the system to handle situations where the Supply Management System notifies about insufficient resources. In this scenario, the Order Management System acts as the subject, and the Supply Management System serves as the observer. This pattern enables efficient communication and notification of changes in resource availability, allowing the system to dynamically respond to shortages.

\subsection{Experiment design}
\label{sec:design}
The evaluation design aims to assess the effectiveness of the system in meeting the specified Quality Attribute Scenarios (QASes) – interoperability and availability. The evaluation involves a systematic approach, including measurements, a pilot test, and detailed analysis of the results.

The experiment design for assessing the interoperability of the mineral water production system emphasizes a systematic approach to evaluate its ability to integrate seamlessly with external systems. The design includes a series of scenarios to simulate real-world interactions with external providers involved in the production process. For instance, scenarios involved with integrating with bottling partners with supply management system, but its not limited to be extend with other systems, like quality control or distribution networks. The expreriment design use of Postman and Newman as primary tools for conducting tests, offering a standardized and automated approach to evaluating API effectiveness and responsiveness. 

The experiment design for evaluating the availability of the mineral water production system places a strong emphasis on creating scenarios that mimic real-world situations where system availability is critical. Scenarios include sudden increases in production demand, simulated server failures, and fluctuations in network stability. These controlled experiments aim to assess the system's ability to maintain seamless operations during both expected and unexpected events. The introduction of varying stress levels, such as increased order volume or temporary network outages, allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the system's responsiveness and resilience. Additionally, the design incorporates the utilization of Locust, a load testing tool, to simulate a large number of concurrent users and assess the system's performance under heavy loads. Specifically, Locust will be configured to test the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol between scheduler system and production management system, which is essential for real-time communication in between scheduler and production system. The experiment also specifically focused on measuring the system's capability to sustain message delivery and handle potential bottlenecks during peak demand scenarios

\subsection{Measurements}
\label{sec:measurements}

The measurements employed in assessing interoperability focus on critical aspects that reflect the effectiveness of the mineral water production system's integration capabilities. Data transfer time and accuracy rate measurements calculate the efficiency of information exchange with external entities, ensuring timely and precise communication. API response time and error rates serve as crucial indicators of the effectiveness of the system's interfaces during real-time interactions with external provider bottling systems. Interoperability metrics include integration time for new partners, showcasing the system's adaptability, and success rates for interface updates, highlighting its ability to evolve alongside changes in external systems. These measurements collectively provide a robust framework for objectively evaluating and improving the mineral water production system's interoperability with its diverse network of partners.

The identified key measurements were utilized to quantify the performance and reliability of the mineral water production system, specifically in terms of availability. These measurements encompassed response times under both normal and stressed conditions. The system metrics served as a means to monitor heightened demand and order amounts.To assess the system's adaptability to varying demands, Locust played a pivotal role. The tool measured metrics such as Requests Per Second (RPS) and response times during MQTT interactions with the Mosquitto message broker. This approach provided valuable insights into the system's scalability and responsiveness in managing real-time communication.Throughout the experiment, the simulation of increased demand was systematically executed by progressively introducing more users. This gradual escalation in user count aimed to measure the system's performance under varying workloads. The Locust tool facilitated load testing for MQTT, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of the mineral water production system's continuous availability and robustness in the face of challenging scenarios.

\subsection{Pilot test}
\label{sec:pilot_test}

A described pilot test was conducted to assess the system's availability. The pilot test aimed to determine the appropriate number of replications needed to ensure robust and reliable results. This involved running a subset of the experiments and analyzing the obtained data to estimate the variability in the measurements.

The results presented in Table~\ref{table:request-stats} provide insights into the request statistics, including the number of requests, failure rates, and response times. Similarly, Table~\ref{table:response-time-stats} details percentiles of the response times observed during the pilot test. The Locust test results are visualized in Figure \ref{fig:locust-test}

\subsection{Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

The experiment design for evaluating the mineral water production system's interoperability and availability is structured to comprehensively assess its performance in meeting specified Quality Attribute Scenarios (QASes) with a particular focus on interoperability and availability. The systematic approach involves real-world scenario simulations, utilizing tools such as Postman, Newman, and Locust, along with detailed measurements and a pilot test to ensure robustness and reliability of the evaluation.

In assessing interoperability, the experiment design emphasizes the seamless integration of the system with external entities, exemplified through scenarios involving bottling partners, supply management systems, and potential extensions to other systems like quality control or distribution networks. The use of Postman and Newman as primary tools ensures a standardized and automated evaluation of API effectiveness and responsiveness.

For availability assessment, the experiment design creates scenarios that mimic critical real-world situations, including sudden increases in production demand, server failures, and network fluctuations. Locust, a load testing tool, is employed to simulate a large number of concurrent users and evaluate the system's performance under heavy loads, specifically testing the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol between scheduler and production management systems.

Measurements employed for interoperability focus on critical aspects such as data transfer time, accuracy rate, API response time, and error rates. These metrics provide a robust framework for objectively evaluating the system's integration capabilities and its ability to evolve alongside changes in external systems. For availability assessment, key measurements include Requests Per Second (RPS) and response times under varying conditions, providing insights into the system's scalability and responsiveness.

The pilot test was conducted to assess the system's availability, determining the appropriate number of replications needed for robust results. The obtained data, presented in tables for request statistics and response time statistics, provides insights into the system's behavior under different conditions. Noteworthy findings include acceptable failure rates and response times within expected ranges, establishing a baseline for further analysis.

\section{Future work}

In order to further enhance the robustness and efficiency of the project, several key areas can be targeted for improvement. First and foremost, a critical evaluation of the choice of programming languages should be conducted to streamline development and reduce maintenance challenges. Consolidating the use of programming languages where possible can simplify the codebase and enhance maintainability.

The adoption of a service mesh, such as Istio, could optimize communication between microservices, providing additional features like load balancing and security. This would contribute to a more resilient and scalable architecture, ensuring efficient interactions between microservices.

Standardizing logging and monitoring practices across all microservices through tools like the ELK Stack or Prometheus will facilitate centralized management of system health. This unified approach allows for easier identification of issues, proactive troubleshooting, and overall system optimization.

Strengthening security measures is imperative, particularly when dealing with external entities and sensitive data. Implementing robust API security measures, conducting regular security audits, and ensuring compliance with industry standards will fortify the system against potential threats and vulnerabilities.

Expanding and refining automated testing strategies will contribute to comprehensive code coverage and early detection of potential issues. Implementing a robust testing framework, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, ensures the reliability and stability of the application throughout its development lifecycle.

Considering a transition from Docker Compose to a more scalable container orchestration tool like Kubernetes is advisable for improved deployment management. This shift enables better scalability, orchestration, and management of containerized applications, especially when deployed across multiple nodes.

Enhanced documentation covering system architecture and API specifications will ensure clarity for developers and stakeholders. Detailed and up-to-date documentation aids in the understanding of system components, reducing the learning curve for new developers and facilitating effective collaboration.
