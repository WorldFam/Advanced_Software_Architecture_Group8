\section{Use Case and Quality Attribute Scenario}
\label{sec:use_case_and_qas}

\subsection{Use Case}
\label{sec:use_case}
\subsubsection{\textbf{Produce Order}}
The use case outlines the systematic process undertaken by the system to manage and fulfill customer orders. In this scenario, the project manager inserts required data for the new order and the system picks it up and act as primary actor, orchestrating various stages of order processing. The use case initiates when a request is made by the customer and project manager proceed with order request by filling customer name, amount and selecting mineral water bottle size.  Upon fulfilling this precondition, the order undergoes a series of steps. Initially, the Order Management System receives and stores the order before transmitting it to the scheduler. The scheduler, requests the necessary resources from the Supply Management System. The supply management system plays a pivotal role by providing the required resources, ensuring the seamless continuation of the order processing. Subsequently, the scheduler queues the order, and the Production Management System accepts and starts the production line process. An alternative flow is accounted for, wherein the Supply Management System may notify about insufficient resources, prompting the system to handle such scenarios appropriately by notifying product manager to reevaluate the order.

\section{The solution}
\label{sec:middleware_architecture}

The design of the system architecture is crucial to achieving the stated Quality Attribute Scenarios (QASes) outlined in the previous section. This section will delve into the proposed design that aims to ensure interoperability, availability, and continuous deployability of the system.

To ensure availability, the system employs a robust monitoring strategy, utilizing a logging system that actively sends logs through websockets from multiple components. This proactive approach enables real-time fault detection, complemented by exception handling in critical areas of the production process to facilitate graceful recovery from faults.

Deployability is enhanced through a well-managed deployment pipeline, incorporating script deployment stages with various commands for linting, artifact uploading, testing, building, and pushing images. Git and GitHub Actions workflows are utilized for version control, continuous integration, and deployment management, ensuring a streamlined CI/CD process with effortless rollback capabilities.

Interoperability holds a pivotal role, especially in collaborations with external partners. The system architecture is deliberately crafted to facilitate seamless communication between the enterprise and external entities. The utilization of a microservices approach enables autonomous scaling and modification of services, catering to evolving business requirements. Despite introducing intricacies, advanced interfaces, and rigorous testing, this approach guarantees the system's adaptability and continuous availability. The system's structure is intentionally designed with modularity and scalability in mind, ensuring efficient handling of customer orders. The architecture embraces microservices to amplify flexibility and maintainability. Each microservice is dedicated to specific functionalities, such as order management, supply management, and production management.

To serve to diverse requirements and components, different programming languages are employed for various microservices within the system. For instance, C\# was used for order management due to its simplicity, while Java was chosen for resource-intensive tasks in supply management. This multilingual approach allows leveraging the strengths of each language for specific functionalities.
However, potential drawbacks include increased complexity and maintenance challenges associated with multiple programming languages.

The system adopts a diverse persistence approach, utilizing MySQL for the supply management system and MongoDB for the order management system. flyway, a reliable database migration tool, was employed specifically for the MySQL database to ensure seamless migration and version control. This strategic use of technologies addresses the unique data storage needs of each microservice, leveraging the strengths of MySQL's reliability and MongoDB's flexibility. The incorporation of flyway streamlines database management, mitigating challenges associated with evolving schemas. While managing multiple database technologies introduces complexity, the tailored solutions enhance performance and scalability for each microservice.

Point-to-point communication between microservices is facilitated through a combination of HTTP/REST APIs and WebSockets, Mosquitto message broker. HTTP/REST APIs are utilized for synchronous communication, enabling microservices to request and respond to each other's services. WebSocket and Mosquitto message broker are employed for asynchronous communication, allowing real-time updates while reducing response time. Mosquitto, an MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) broker, facilitates lightweight and efficient communication, especially suitable for scenarios where low latency and minimal overhead are crucial. This ensures reliable asynchronous communication and decoupling of services.

Containerization was implemented using Docker and Docker Compose to allow define and manage the services comprising the system. Each individual service had build Docker image inside CI/CD pipeline that would be push to Github Container Registry. Docker Compose simplified the orchestration and deployment of multiple containers, ensuring consistency across different environments, including development (local) and production (deployed to VM). However, approach using might to be suitable to make application completetly scalable as docker compose only allows to deploy to a single server. Better approach would be using Docker Swarm or more advanced scaling tool like K8s (Kubernetes) to manage containers deployed across multiple nodes. [14]

The Observer Pattern is applied in the system to handle situations where the Supply Management System notifies about insufficient resources. In this scenario, the Order Management System acts as the subject, and the Supply Management System serves as the observer. This pattern enables efficient communication and notification of changes in resource availability, allowing the system to dynamically respond to shortages.

\section{Future work}

In order to further enhance the robustness and efficiency of the project, several key areas can be targeted for improvement. First and foremost, a critical evaluation of the choice of programming languages should be conducted to streamline development and reduce maintenance challenges. Consolidating the use of programming languages where possible can simplify the codebase and enhance maintainability.

The adoption of a service mesh, such as Istio, could optimize communication between microservices, providing additional features like load balancing and security. This would contribute to a more resilient and scalable architecture, ensuring efficient interactions between microservices.

Standardizing logging and monitoring practices across all microservices through tools like the ELK Stack or Prometheus will facilitate centralized management of system health. This unified approach allows for easier identification of issues, proactive troubleshooting, and overall system optimization.

Strengthening security measures is imperative, particularly when dealing with external entities and sensitive data. Implementing robust API security measures, conducting regular security audits, and ensuring compliance with industry standards will fortify the system against potential threats and vulnerabilities.

Expanding and refining automated testing strategies will contribute to comprehensive code coverage and early detection of potential issues. Implementing a robust testing framework, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, ensures the reliability and stability of the application throughout its development lifecycle.

Considering a transition from Docker Compose to a more scalable container orchestration tool like Kubernetes is advisable for improved deployment management. This shift enables better scalability, orchestration, and management of containerized applications, especially when deployed across multiple nodes.

Enhanced documentation covering system architecture and API specifications will ensure clarity for developers and stakeholders. Detailed and up-to-date documentation aids in the understanding of system components, reducing the learning curve for new developers and facilitating effective collaboration.
